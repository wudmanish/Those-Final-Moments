You’re on the plain between life and death.
Everything is slipping away.
You don’t feel anything…
I light appears in front you.
“What a tragedy. You have only but one day to live. Make the most of it”

Thank god it’s all a dream.
However, not all is right. A dark figure stands by your bed.
It was not a dream. There is no denying it, you are going to die tonight.
